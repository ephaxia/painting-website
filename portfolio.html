        <p>
          This customer is vegan, and wanted a design which revolved around a
          tattoo which they had of a cartoon carrot!
        </p>
        <p>
          I took their cartoon tattoo and created lots of different fruits and
          vegetables, all in different positions until we were happy with the
          layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we'd decided on the layout, I added them to the shoes along with
          a couple of personal touches, such as the crown, as David is also a
          huge fan of Strava KOMS!
        </p>
        <p>
          Because he is such a fan of climbing, I also added some little
          abstract mountains on the inside of the shoe, just to add a little
          subtle contrast to the cartoons.
