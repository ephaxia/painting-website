          Welcome to Ephaxia Designs, the place for custom painted cycling
          shoes
        </p>
        <p>
          I paint as a hobby, and enjoy it so much, as it gives me the
          opportuity to be creative and produce custom artworks for each client.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this website you'll find a portfolio of my works, along with some
          works I'd like to collaborate and produce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should you like what's on show, or think I could possibly design your
          next set of shoes, get in touch using the contact page and lets have a
          chat
        </p>
